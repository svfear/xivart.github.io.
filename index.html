<h1>Subdomain Takeover by Svfear</h1>`

    Attempt to Assign Custom Domain
    In the GitHub Pages settings of the repository, try to assign the custom domain actions.tooling.travix.com.

    Observe Domain Verification Failure
    GitHub will display an error message:

        "You must verify your domain..."
        This occurs because you do not control the DNS for actions.tooling.travix.com.

    Confirm Dangling Subdomain
    Since the DNS points to a non-existent repo in the original ownerâ€™s account but you can create the repository yourself, the subdomain is dangling and vulnerable to takeover if verification is bypassed or changes.
